# Wavelet Interface Network (WIN) 

This repository contains the official implementation of the **Wavelet Interface Network (WIN)** implemented for Audio Deepfake Detection (ADD) using wavelet-based feature mapping.

The proposed model integrates signal preprocessing, learnable Sinc-based frontend, positional aggregation, and wavelet-based attention for robust anti-spoofing.
